# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# Test data
# Service.destroy_all
# User.destroy_all
# Service.create(name: "Moving helper", location: "Riaydh", price: 120, contact: "1234567", status: false, time: "11pm", user_id: 1)
# Service.create(name: "Electronic helper", location: "Riaydh", price: 120, contact: "1234567", status: false, time: "11pm", user_id: 2)
